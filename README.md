# Bittorrent Playground
Place for all the code related to bittorrent.

I'm planning to add:
1. Bencoding Decoder (Bittorrent protocol parser, which can be used for .torrent files)
2. Seeds / Tracker visualizer (Get a .torrent file, visualize Geo Location & network activity of nodes in the network)
3. Distributed Hash Table stuff (I don't know how it works, so want to try it out)

## Motivation
I've always thought that Torrent protocols are so interesting and awesome. And the best way to understand it would be to implement the functionalities of a Torrent program from scratch.
